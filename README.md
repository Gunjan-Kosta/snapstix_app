## 📸 What is SnapStix?
The name **SnapStix** is a playful fusion of **Snap** (capturing a quick photo) and **Stickers** (the expressive digital result). 

The core mission of SnapStix is to bridge the gap between your real-life memories and your digital conversations. It allows users to upload any picture—be it a selfie, a group photo, or a pet—and instantly receive a customized, high-quality cartoon sticker library that captures their unique essence.

## ✨ Core Functions & Features

### 1. The "Magic Pack" Generation
SnapStix doesn't just make one sticker; it creates a personality. From a single photo upload, the AI "brews" a collection of 5 distinct expressive stickers:
- **😊 Happy**: A classic, cheerful representation.
- **😎 Cool**: Stylized with confidence and attitude.
- **😲 Shocked**: High-impact expressive reaction.
- **😍 Heart-eyes**: Perfect for affectionate moments.
- **😉 Winking**: Playful, friendly, and social.

### 2. Chat-Ready Optimization (WhatsApp & More)
To ensure your stickers look professional in actual conversations, SnapStix performs real-time processing:
- **Format**: Automatically converts images to **WEBP**, the standard for WhatsApp and Telegram.
- **Dimensions**: Resizes every creation to a perfect **512x512 pixels**.
- **Visuals**: Adds the iconic **white die-cut border** to ensure stickers stand out against both light and dark chat themes.

### 3. Direct Native Sharing
Integrated with the **Web Share API**, SnapStix allows you to skip the "save to gallery, then upload" hurdle. You can tap the chat icon to trigger your phone's native share sheet and send your sticker directly into a WhatsApp, Telegram, or iMessage thread.

### 4. Smart Local Storage
Your sticker collection is yours to keep. The app features a **Persistent Gallery** that uses your browser's local storage. We've implemented **Intelligent Quota Management** that automatically prunes heavy source data while keeping the lightweight stickers, ensuring you never run out of space.

### 5. AI-Powered Artistry
Leveraging the **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** model, SnapStix uses advanced Vision-to-Image prompting. It recognizes facial features and recreates them using "Cel-Shaded" vector logic, ensuring the result is a recognizable but fun cartoon version of the original "Snap."
